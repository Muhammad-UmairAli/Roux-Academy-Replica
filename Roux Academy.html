			<h1>Fall registration is now open</h1><br>
			<p>Here at Roux, we’re as excited for the upcoming school year as we are this one. Visiting professors Barry Mandow (renowned photojournalist) and Rebecca Short (textile designer) will be joining us in the fall and construction on the Roux North remodel will be completed by October.</p><br>

			<p>Registration for the Fall semester opens May 13th. Current students: don’t forget to sign up for your registration appointment. If you’re a prospective student looking to apply to Roux, now is the time to meet with a counselor to polish up those last remaining application details and complete any necessary paperwork for grants and scholarships.

			<h1>Victor Stuesse wins Lacie Award</h1><br>
			<p>Victor Stuesse is the recipient of this year’s Lacie Award, dedicated to honoring the work of a professor who has touched lives both inside and outside of the Roux community. As a teacher, Professor Stuesse has ushered over 900 students through the Craft + Design program, and has always been willing to share the secrets of his craft. As a sculptor and restorer, he has donated his time to public works projects such as the Central Park Arts Maintenance Council and the Metropolitan Museum’s docent program.</p><br>
			<p>
			Professor Stuesse has had a long and successful career in the arts, having received many commissions over the years in cities from Chicago to Bangkok, but always returns to “the job I call a dream.” For his dedication to teaching and community involvement, the Roux Academy is proud to award him with this year’s prize, which also includes a stipend for pursuit of personal projects outside the academy. Congratulations, Professor Stuesse!</p>
